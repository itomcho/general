Hi, I'm Ian 👋

I'm a Senior Program Manager at AWS with a passion for the technical side of things. After spending years translating business requirements into technical solutions, I'm now deepening my skills to bridge the gap between program management and engineering teams more effectively.

🔧 Technical Journey
I'm currently expanding my technical capabilities through focused learning:
📚 Completing Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science
🐍 Developing Python programming skills
📊 Building proficiency in SQL and data analysis
☁️ Deepening my understanding of cloud architecture principles

📈 Current Focus Areas
* Building technical proof-of-concepts using Python for automation
* Developing data integration solutions and analytics pipelines
* Enhancing systems design and architecture knowledge

🌲 Beyond Technology
When I'm not working on technical projects, you can find me:
* SCUBA diving (certified Divemaster)
* Hiking throughout Colorado
* Playing acoustic & electric guitar
* Exploring new countries (18 and counting)

📫 Let's Connect
I'm always interested in connecting with fellow technologists and program managers who are passionate about the intersection of technical innovation and business impact.
